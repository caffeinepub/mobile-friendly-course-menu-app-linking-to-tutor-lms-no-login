  "summary": "The diff implements the core course catalog app with manual/remote data sources, search, list/grid toggle, course detail with external open action, a warm non-blue theme, and persisted settings. However, it also introduces Internet Identity/auth-related infrastructure and backend actor scaffolding that were not requested and conflict with the \"no login/auth\" constraint. Image assets required by the BuildRequest are referenced but not verifiable from the provided diff summary.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "No login/authentication flow should be present; users access the course list immediately on load.",
